# LoginSystem
Node based login system using Express, Mongo and Passport

In practice I generally wouldn't embed front end logic into the backend, in commercial apps I'd separate the backend logic out and just expose REST endpoints, then introduce a front end built in something like React or Vue, but for this demo it allows me to provide an interface to use to interact with the server without having to use cURL or Postman, and without needing a separate front end installed.
